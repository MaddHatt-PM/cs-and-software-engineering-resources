# The Interview Process
It is not uncommon to only go through one question in a single interview session.  
It is important to talk out loud to let your interviewer know of your internal thought process.  
An interviewer may interject to provide feedback in the moment. You should accept the feedback and remember an interview is a conversation.

An interview session may assess one or more of the following characteristics:
- Analytical skills: How well did your solution solve the problems? If your decision has tradeoffs, did you discuss them?
- Coding skills: Did your solution translate well to code? How was your code clean and readable?
- Communication skills: How well did you communicate to your interviews. 
- Fundamental and Technical knowledge: Do you have a strong foundation in computer science?
- Experience: Does your experience from other projects translate to you being a stronger applicant
- Cultural fit: Would you be a good fit for this company?

## Why are interviews setup this way?
Cons of this interview style:
- The interview structure can feel so unfamiliar they turn away great candidates.
- Answers can be looked up and referenced beforehand.
- Some concepts are rarely used in real-world settings. If there are used, there are resources available to build them on the spot.

Pros of this interview style:
- False negatives are possible and good candidates are rejected. This avoids companies hiring people who only do well in interviews.
- Problem-solving skills are highly valued by companies and this format emphasizes that.
- Foundational knowledge is tested to showcase your knowledge to the interviewer.
  - Note: Most problems will have some basis in algorithms and data structures that is very rare to not encounter a problem without them.
- Whiteboards let you focus on your thought process and psuedocode rather than syntax and compiler restrictions.

Not all interviews will prioritize the technical interview.
Some may value prior experience or specific needs based on the company's interests.

## How questions are selected?
It is a common misconception that companies keep a list of technical questions to use.
In actuality, the interviewer may just so happened to have picked a certain question.
Companies may prefer their interviewers to focus on specific topics for a position (ie: system design).

## How are you evaluated?
Interviews will judge applicants by feel and relative experiences.
If a problem typically takes 10 minutes on average, but all applicants took longer than 20 minutes. This pool of applicants may all be rejected.
Remember: If a problem is difficult for you, it is likely to be harder for everyone else.

## Frequently asked questions
`I didn't hear back immediately after my interview? Am I rejected?`

If you haven't heard back within a business week, politely check in with your recruiter.

`Can I re-apply to a company after getting rejected?`
Yes but it may have to wait 6 months to a year.
People have been known to recieve offers after multiple interviews.
