# Growth of Functions
The required resource to solve a problem depending on the number of steps it uses.
For this class, Time Complexity will be the focus but it is important to remember Space Complexity.
Space Complexity is often more for microsystems where memory is limited by physical size.

A way to denote a category of Time and Space Complexity is through `Big O Notation`.
The categories from smallest to largest go:
- `O(1)`: Constant time.
