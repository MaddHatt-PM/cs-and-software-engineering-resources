# Behind the Scenes
Most companies follow a similar structure for their interviews.
Interview Types (In order):
- Screening Interview: 
  - Typically over the phone, via video call, or in person (rare).
  - Often involves coding and algorithm questions.
  - Reasonable to ask your recruiter if this step will be a technical interview.
  - Recruiters may assign takehome homework
  - Typically 1-2 screenings 
- Onsite/in-person interview
  - More technical interviews
  - Behavioral/experience based questions
- Lunch interview
  - More relaxed conversation to have the applicant learn more about company culture
  - Interviewer may not even submit feedback
  - Included with the onsite/in-person category

Note: Interviewers are given a large range of freedom for how they wish to conduct their interview

After the last interview, the interviewers will meet together to discuss and provide feedback to the applicant.
It may take between 0-7 days for the interviewers to provide feedback.
Your recruiter will be a middleman for providing this information to you.
Note: If no response is given, this does not neccessarily correspond to a rejection. It is very unusual to get a silent rejection. 


## The Microsoft Interview
You'll arrive in the morning.
After signing a few pieces of paperwork, you'll meet up with a recruiter who will give you a sample question.
Your recruiter will be there to prep you for the rest of the process, not to test you.
Your recruiter may guide in with easier questions if they see that you're nervous.
Note: Your recruiter can push to get you re-interviewed if they believe in you that much.

You'll then be interviewed four or five times, often from two different teams.
Rather than meeting in a special room, you'll be meeting in the interviewer's office.
Depending on the team, your interviewer may or may not share feedback on you with the others in the interview cycle.

After interviews, you may speak with a hiring manager if you were seen as a favorable applicant to one of the teams.
At this point, it is the hiring manager's decision.
You may get a decision that day or within a week depending on internal factors.


## The Amazon Interview
The interviewing process starts with a phone screening with a specific team.
You'll be presorted into a particular team's applicant pool.
If you recieve multiple phone screening, one of the interviewers may not be completely set on you or you are being considered for another team.

You'll have a technical interview in which you'll write code in a shared editor.

You'll be flown out to an office where more interviews will be conducted.
You will be coding on a whiteboard.
There may be 4-5 of these interviews with one or two different teams.
These interviewers are unable to see the feedback from other interviewers.
Of these interviewers, there will be a `bar raiser` who is responsible with a much tougher problem and has veto power in the hiring decision.

After your interviews, all the interviewers will come together to meet and discuss their applicants.
A final decision will likely be available within a week's time.
These people will be responsible for whether to hire you.


## The Google Interview
This interview is not too different that Microsoft's and Amazon's interview processes.

The interviewing process starts with a phone screening.
This may or not be involve a coding segment with a shared editor.
Over the phone applicants will recieve the same level of difficulty as those in the on-site interviews.

For your onsite interviews, you'll interview with 4-6 people with one interview being over lunch.
Each interviewer can conduct their interview however they wish.
Information across interviewers are kept private from each other, rather they are submitted to a hiring committee.
The lunch interview does not submit information, so this is a good opportunity to ask questions.

After the interview, written feedback is given to a hiring committee to move forward.
Hiring committees are looking for a single high score rather than a safer average score.
Note: The phone interview is not regarded too highly at this point.

If a hiring committee moves forward, they will recommend your application to a compensation committee.
After that committee, an executive committee will make the final decision.
It is somewhat unusual for the executive committee to reject the hiring committee's decision.
Due to all the committees, it may take a several weeks to hear back.


## The Apple Interview
Note: Apple does not specifically seek out applicants that only use Apple products, but it definitly helps to be familiar.
Note: Company structure: Organizations > Teams > Developers

The interviewing process starts with a phone screening to get a surface level idea of your skills.
Afterward, there will be multiple technical interviews over the phone with team members.

Once invited to campus, a recruiter will meet with you to give an overview of the process.
There will be 6-8 interviews with members of the team and individuals that routinely works with that team.
These may be 1-on-1 or 2-on-1 style whiteboard interviews.
One interview will consist with your future manager.

Towards the end, your interviews will meet up to determine if you are a viable candidate.
If you are not, you will be escorted out.

If you move forward, you will have a meeting with the Director and VP of the organization.
The final approval process will include all interviewers with the VP having veto power.


## The Facebook (Meta) Interview
The interviewing process starts with 1-2 phone screenings.
Typically these will include a coding portion in a shared editor.
You may be given a programming assignment involving algorithms and cleaniness.

Onsite interviews will consist of hiring managers and other software engineers.
Each interviewer will focus on a specific topic (ie: behavioral, coding/algorithms, design/architecture).
With these questions, you might be required to discuss different solutions and their tradeoffs.
Interviews will independently submit written feedback.

The interviewing team and the hiring manager will get together for the final decision.


## The Palantir Interview
Palantir will interview candidates for specific teams from the start.
Your application may be rerouted to a different team if you may be a better applicant for them.

The interviewing process starts with two phone interviews (30-45 minutes).
These will focus on your prior experience and some algorithmic problems.
You may be given a take-home assignment, especially for those in school.
Assignments will likely be from [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and will be difficult questions.

Onsite, applicants will be interviewed by up to 5 people.
Topics will include prior experience, knowledge relevant for the role and team, data structures, algorithms, and design.
You may be given the chance to demo some Palantir products. Be sure to have an engaging conversation.

The interviewing team and the hiring manager will get together for the final decision.
