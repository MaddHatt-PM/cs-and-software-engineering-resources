Created a HashSet that used a LinkedList to handle collisions.
On seeing other people's approaches, I noticed that someone used a Binary Search Tree (BST) for their approach.
I was able to tune my underlying `data` array to get the most efficiency around 750 entires.
My solution does not handle resizing and rebalancing.
