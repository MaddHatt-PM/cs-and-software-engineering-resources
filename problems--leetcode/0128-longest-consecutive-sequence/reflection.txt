I definitely overcomplicated this problem due to the soft time complexity constraint.
As I thought any usage of set would disqualify myself as it is a O(N) operation.
However, any iteration on the set would be O(N+M) with a worse case of M=N so O(2N).
Since constants are removed, O(2N) would be O(N).
